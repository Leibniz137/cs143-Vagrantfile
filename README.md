This is a Vagrantfile for the Stanford/Coursera MOOC on [Compilers](https://class.coursera.org/compilers-004/).

This Vagrantfile uses the official [precise32 boxfile](http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box) hosted by [vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es).
During the provisioning process, the [tar archive](http://spark-university.s3.amazonaws.com/stanford-compilers/vm/student-dist.tar.gz) for Compilers CS143 to /usr/class/cs143.

I have tried to keep this as straightforward as possible for the end-user.

Keep in mind you are downloading something from the internet.
